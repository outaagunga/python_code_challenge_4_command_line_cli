Project Idea: Task Manager CLI

Project Description:
I will create a Command Line Interface (CLI) Task Manager application that allows me to manage my tasks. This project will help me learn and practice the concepts of database modeling with SQLAlchemy, working with CLI interfaces, and implementing a basic algorithm

Key Features:

Task Management: Users should be able to add, view, update, and delete tasks.

Task Categories: Tasks can belong to different categories (e.g., work, personal, shopping).

Due Dates: Each task can have an optional due date.

Priority: Allow users to assign a priority level to each task (e.g., high, medium, low).

CLI Interface: Implement a user-friendly CLI interface that allows users to interact with the task manager using commands and options.

Database: Use SQLAlchemy ORM to create a database schema with at least three related tables (e.g., Users, Tasks, Categories).

Algorithm: Implement a simple algorithm to sort tasks based on priority or due date.

Best Practices: Follow best practices in CLI design, code organization, and documentation.

Project Steps:

Plan the database schema, considering the tables needed for users, tasks, and categories, and define their relationships.

Set up a virtual environment using Pipenv.

Create Python classes for the database models (Users, Tasks, Categories) using SQLAlchemy ORM.

Build the CLI interface using a library like Click or Fire, allowing me to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

Implement the algorithm to sort tasks based on priority or due date.

Test the CLI application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

Organize the code into separate modules for database models, CLI commands, and utilities.

Document the code using comments and docstrings.
